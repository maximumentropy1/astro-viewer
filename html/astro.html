    <p id='explanation'>Ever wanted to know why stars shine, why the planets look the way they do and what a black hole really is? Through the use of physics, we can discover how stars and planets we’ve never visited live and change. There are over twenty uniquely different objects marked out on the night sky, each one related to a different aspect of physics or astronomy. By looking for them and reading through their descriptions, you’ll learn principles such as parallax, gas pressure, nuclear fusion, and energy radiation. You’ll also get to see some beautiful images taken by satellites and telescopes such as the Hubble Space Telescope. Try and find all of them!</p>
